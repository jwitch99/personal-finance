# Personal Finance : 

Since when I moved to Bangalore I've been monitoring my expenses. Every night I used to fill the data in an Excel sheet. And this is my personal finance dashboard where I have plotted various charts representing my spendings...

----------------------------

## Approach : 

* So Initially I have used an <code>.ipynb</code> file to do the preprocessing and do some visualization

* Then I have made another file <code>finance.py</code> to implement all the functions related to preprocessing and plotting

* I have imported the same file in <code>app.py</code> and used it along with streamlit to build the app.

------------------------------

## How to run? 

> To run the app you need to download this repository along with the required libraries and it the command line you have to write <code>streamlit run app.py</code> to run. 

> it might ask for your email once...
